# PyFR Film Cooling Computations

JB October 2020

## Setup

Change to your HPC working directory, clone this repository, and run the
installation script inside it:

```
   cd ~/rds/rds-hpc-work
   git clone https://github.com/jb753/pyfr-film-cooling.git
   cd pyfr-film-cooling
   ./install-pyfr.sh
```

From now on, we can prepare the environment for PyFR by running,

```
   activate-pyfr
```

and the `pyfr` commond will then work.

## Examples

There are three sample cases in the `examples` folder; for instructions see
[PyFR User Guide](http://www.pyfr.org/user_guide.php) and scroll down to the
bottom.
